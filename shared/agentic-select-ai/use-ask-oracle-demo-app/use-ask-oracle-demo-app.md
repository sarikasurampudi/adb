# Use the Ask Oracle Chatbot App

## Introduction

This lab provides a hands-on tour of the “Ask Oracle” demo chatbot app. Here, you’ll use the chatbot to run the agent team created and enhanced in the previous labs. While we’ll focus on interacting with an agent team, this APEX-based app allows you to interact with your data using natural language prompts for RAG and NL2SQL with AI profiles already defined. You’ll open the app, review at the settings, specify NL2SQL   and RAG AI profiles, and pick an AI Agent. Then, try a few prompts - just click and chat.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Access the Ask Oracle chatbot app.
* Review the **Settings**.
* Choose an AI Agent to chat with.
* Run some sample prompts.

### Prerequisites
- This lab requires the completion of all the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.
- Autonomous Database is reachable from your browser environment.

> Note: If you are independently using OML Notebook on your instance to run the code, append `%script` at the beginning for the codeblocks.

## Task 1: Create NL2SQL Profile
To create NL2SQL profile:
1. Add a paragraph in your OML Notebook by clicking the **+** symbol.
![Add a paragraph](./images/add-paragraph.png)

2. Create a NL2SQL Profile by pasting the following code.
  ```
  <copy>

    
  BEGIN
    DBMS_CLOUD_AI.CREATE_PROFILE(
        profile_name =>'OCI_GENAI',
        attributes   =>'{"provider": "oci",
        "credential_name": "AI_CREDENTIAL",
        "conversation": "true",
        "object_list": [{"owner": "SH", "name": "customers"},
                        {"owner": "SH", "name": "countries"},
                        {"owner": "SH", "name": "supplementary_demographics"},
                        {"owner": "SH", "name": "profits"},
                        {"owner": "SH", "name": "promotions"},
                        {"owner": "SH", "name": "products"}]
          }');
  END;
  /
  </copy>
  ```

## Task 2: Access the Application

1. Launch the demo app. Paste the URL in a new tab in your Web browser, and then click **[ENTER]**. In the **Ask Oracle** page, enter the username and password, and then click **Sign In**. Refer to **Lab 1** -> **Task 4**.

  ![Enter Ask Oracle Chatbot credentials](./images/ask-oracle-login.png =70%x*)

2. The **Set Admin Users** window in the **Ask Oracle Select AI** application is displayed. Type the schema name that has access to Select AI Profiles. For example, `ADB_USER` in the **Admin usernames** field and click **Save Admin Users**.
   ![Enter comma separated usernames as Admin users](./images/ask-oracle-set-admin-users.png =70%x*)

3. The **Ask Oracle Select AI Chatbot** application is displayed.
    
4. In the **Ask Question** prompt field, click the **+** menu and select **Agent Team**.  Notice that the bottom right indicates that agent team is `RETURN_AGENCY_TEAM`. You will see a section on the right of the conversation prompt that allows you to switch the Agent Team Profile. If you have configured other agent profiles using Select AI Agent framework, click the pull-down menu and select `RETURN_AGENCY_TEAM` profile. This profile was created in **Task 9 of Lab 2**.
   ![Select OCI_GENAI profile](./images/ask-oracle-enter-prompt-agents.png =70%x*)

You are now ready to ask questions at the prompt area!


## Task 3: Interact with the Sales Return Agent

For example, follow this script:
- “I want to return a smartphone case”
- “The item is defective”
- “I will need a replacement”
- “I'm Bob Martinez and my order number is 7820”
- “No thank you”

## Task 4: (Optional) Ask Natural Language and Database Questions Using the Application

You use the Ask Oracle Select AI chatbot application to interact with both a large language model (LLM) and your Autonomous AI Database through a single conversational interface.
The application supports two modes of interaction:

- **Ask the LLM Directly:**
Click the **+** and select **NL2SQL**. _Uncheck the  **Database** checkbox_ ask general free form questions (internet-based) about anything such as:

  _Give me a recipe for french toast._
  
  This prompt is sent to the LLM that you selected when you created the profile and returns the response.
  ![Ask the LLM](./images/ask-oracle-uncheck-database.png =70%x*)

- **Ask your Database :**
Click the **+** and select **NL2SQL**. _Select the **Database** checkbox_ to ask questions about your database data based on the user and tables in the database that you specified when you created the profile.
  
  ![Ask your database](./images/ask-oracle-check-database.png =70%x*)


Let's experiment a bit with both general data from the _internet_ and also from the schema tables in the database.

1. Let's find out how to make french toast. Enter your question using a free form format in the **Ask Question** text box, and make sure that the **Database** checkbox is _not checked_ since this is a general internet question that will be handled by your LLM provider. Next, click the **Run** icon, or press **[ENTER]**.
   
    > You can type your own natural language question. You don't have to use the exact question that we show in our examples.
  
  ![Ask the LLM](./images/ask-oracle-french-toast-recipe.png =70%x*)

  A French toast recipe is displayed.

  ![LLM's response](./images/ask-oracle-french-toast-recipe-display.png =70%x*)

<!-- - **Generate narrated result:**
_Check the **Database** and **Narrate** checkbox_ to ask questions about your database data based on the user and tables in the database specified in the AI profile such as:

  _How many customers are females?_

    ![Select Database and Narrate checkboxes](./images/ask-oracle-narrate.png =70%x*) -->

2. Let's find out _How many customers do I have in each country?_ Enter your question using a free form format in the **Ask Question** text box, and select the **Database** checkbox since this is a question about the tables present in the OCI_GENAI profile. Next, press **[ENTER]**. 
   The number of customers along with the countries are displayed.
  ![Select Database and ask database tables related question](./images/ask-oracle-database.png =70%x*)

3. Click **Explain** to view and explain the SQL query behind this natural language question.
   ![Click Explain to view the explanation of the generated SQL](./images/ask-oracle-explain.png =70%x*)
4. When you finish reviewing, click the Back icon (left arrow) to return to the conversation on Home page.
   ![Click Explain to view the generated SQL](./images/ask-oracle-explain-sql.png =70%x*)
5. Now, click **Explore**.
   ![Select Explore](./images/ask-oracle-explore.png =70%x*)
   The **Explore** page is displayed.
   ![Select Explore](./images/ask-oracle-explore-display.png =70%x*)
6. Click the **Actions** drop-down list to perform several tasks on the generated data such as sorting, downloading, formatting, charting and much more. For details on using the actions tasks, see the embedded video in the **Introduction** section of this lab. 
  ![Select Actions and explore various options](./images/ask-oracle-explore-actions.png =70%x*)
7. When you finish exploring, click the **Back** icon (left arrow) to return to the conversation on Home page. Now, click **Show SQL**.
  ![Select Show SQL](./images/ask-oracle-showsql.png =70%x*)
8. You can now see the SQL code generated by Select AI.
   ![View generated SQL](./images/ask-oracle-showsql-display.png =70%x*)
9. Finally, there is also a button to **Show Charts** that enables you to play interactively with the data.
    ![Select Show Charts](./images/ask-oracle-show-charts.png =70%x*)
   
   The chart is displayed:
   ![Displays a bar chart of the data](./images/ask-oracle-show-charts-display.png =70%x*)

  > LLMs are remarkable at inferring intent from the human language and they are getting better all the time; however, they are not perfect! It is very important to verify the results.
   
  <!--  Uncheck **Narrate**. Use the following prompt:
  
    _How many customers do I have in each country?_
  
    Ask another follow up question such as:
  
    _Break that out by gender_
  
      ![Uncheck Narrate and have conversation](./images/ask-oracle-uncheck-narrate.png =70%x*)
  
  3. Click **Explain**. 
  
      ![Click Explain](./images/ask-oracle-explain.png =70%x*)
  
    The following screen displays:
  
      ![Explains the SQL](./images/ask-oracle-explain-sql.png)
  
    When finished viewing, click the back arrow and continue with the following script:
  
    _Can you change that to have the country in one column and other columns such as male, female and total?_
  
    _Display this result in a bar chart_
  
    _Put the results in descending_
  
    _How many customers do I have in each country?_
  
  
  - **Use RAG:**
  Click **+** and select **RAG** to ask questions using retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Before you submit the prompt, ensure that the RAG profile `SALES_AGENT_RAG_PROFILE` created earlier in **Lab 5** is selected. Ask questions relative to the corresponding vector index content for Select AI to augment your prompt with relevant content for the LLM. We have created a vector index in **Lab 5** -> **Task 1**.
  
  1. First, we’ll just ask our LLM without RAG, so select the **Chat** checkbox. The LLM returns a general response describing Select AI RAG capabilities based on its training, without using any content from your vector index.
  
    _What are the benefits of Select AI for retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?_
  
      ![Select Chat](./images/ask-oracle-rag-chat.png =70%x*)
  
  2. Uncheck **Chat** and then ask:
  
    _what are alternatives for the smartphone case_
  
    > **Tip**: Ask a question based on the RAG profile you selected, which references the documents stored in your vector database. 
    
    Select AI now uses retrieval augmented generation to ground the response in your vector index. The LLM returns recommendations based on the content of your documents, not general model knowledge.
  
  3. Let’s see the specific chunks provided to the LLM, so select the **Show chunk details** checkbox.
  
    _What do I need to specify in my AI profile to enable RAG?_
  
    ![Show chunk details](./images/ask-oracle-show-chunk-details.png =70%x*)
  
    Select AI splits source documents into smaller units called chunks and stores them in the vector index. During a RAG query, Select AI retrieves the most relevant chunks using semantic search and adds them to the prompt sent to the LLM. This process gives the model focused context from your documents and helps reduce hallucinations.

    ```
    
    This should display the installed versions.

## Task 3: Obtain Autonomous AI Database MCP Server Endpoint

Recall that you have enabled MCP Server and obtained the database instance OCID. After enabling the MCP Server, the database exposes a REST endpoint that you can configure in your MCP-compliant client application.
The endpoint format is as follows:

  ```
  <copy>
  https://dataaccess.adb.<region-identifier>.oraclecloudapps.com/adb/mcp/v1/databases/{database-ocid}
  
  </copy>
  ```

Replace the placeholders with your actual information:

  - {`region-identifier`}: The specific Oracle Cloud region. For example, if your database instance is in Chicago region, the region-identifier is us-chicago-1.
  - {`database-ocid`}: The OCID of your Autonomous AI Database


## Task 4: Configure Claude Desktop as an MCP client

You'll update the Claude Desktop configuration so it can connect to the Autonomous AI Database MCP Server. You will edit a configuration file and provide the MCP server configuration details, enabling Claude Desktop to access tools and data from your database.

1. Open the Claude Desktop application.
       - If prompted, sign in using your account credentials.
2. Go to **Settings**.
![Claude Desktop main window](../configure-claude-desktop/images/claude-desktop-main.png =70%x*)
3. In **Settings**, under the **Desktop app** section, click **Developer**.
  ![Click Developer under Settings](./images/claude-setting-developer.png =70%x*)
4. Click **Edit Config** to open or edit the `claude_desktop_config` JSON configuration file.
  ![Edit config file](./images/claude-edit-config.png =70%x*)
5. Add the following JSON configuration to define your MCP server:

    ```
    <copy>
      {
    "mcpServers": {
      "Autonomous_AI_database_mcp_server": {
        "description": "Database containing application-related data",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "mcp-remote",
          "https://dataaccess.adb.{region-identifier}.oraclecloudapps.com/adb/mcp/v1/databases/{database-ocid}"
        ],
        "transport": "streamable-http"
      }
    }
  }

    </copy>
    ```
    - Replace `{region-identifier}` with your Oracle Cloud region. For example, if your database instance is in Chicago region, the `region-identifier` is `us-chicago-1`.
    - Replace `{database-ocid}` with the OCID of your Autonomous AI Database that you copied in **Lab 2**.
6. **Save** the configuration file.
7. Completely quit Claude Desktop and ensure it is not running in the background.
       - On Windows, open **Task Manager**, search for any running Claude processes, and end all of them.
8. Restart Claude Desktop app. 
9. When prompted, enter your database credentials:
    - Username: **hrm_user**
    - Password: **QwertY#19_95**
    ![Claude Desktop main window](../configure-claude-desktop/images/claude-oauth-authentication.png =70%x*)
10. Claude connects to MCP Server and retrieves available tools for your user profile.

## Task 5: Validate MCP Server is Running
Before proceeding, confirm that the MCP Server is running.
1. Return to Claude Desktop **Settings** → **Desktop app** → **Developer**.
2. You should see "Autonomous\_AI\_database\_mcp\_server" (or the name you assigned in the config) listed as an MCP server and the MCP Server in **running** state.
  ![MCP Server status](./images/claude-mcp-running.png =70%x*)

## Task 6: Review and Control Tool Access

Before you begin using Claude Desktop with your Autonomous AI Database, it's important to review if Claude has successfully retrieved the registered database tools and manage the tools the MCP client can access. 

To view the available tools and control their permissions, ensuring that only approved tools are accessible through Claude Desktop:

1. In **Settings** → Click **Connectors**  → Click **Configure** next to the MCP Server name.
  ![Claude Desktop main window](../configure-claude-desktop/images/claude-connectors-configure.png =70%x*)
2. Click and expand **Other tools**. 
  ![Click Other tools](./images/mcp-connectors-configure-othertools.png =70%x*)
3. Review the tools available to Claude Desktop. 
  ![Claude Desktop main window](../configure-claude-desktop/images/claude-connectors-tools.png =70%x*)
4. By default, all tools require your approval. Here in this lab, leave the defaults.
5. To always allow a tool, click the circled checkmark. 
6. To block a tool, click the lined circle (the tool will not be visible to Claude Desktop).

Claude Desktop is now fully integrated with your Autonomous AI Database.

## Troubleshooting
If Claude Desktop does not connect or authenticate correctly, review the following checks:


*Claude Does Not Prompt for Database Credentials*

If Claude Desktop does not prompt for database login credentials after restart, the issue is usually caused by cached authentication data.

Try the following steps in order.

#### Option 1: Clear Claude Cache (Recommended First Step)

2. Open Claude Desktop.

3. Click **Menu**.

4. Select **Help**.

5. Click **Troubleshooting**.

6. Choose **Clear Cache and Restart**.

After restart, Claude should prompt for database credentials again.

#### Option 2: Clean MCP Authentication Cache

#### On macOS or Linux, run:

  ```
  <copy>
  rm -rf ~/.mcp_auth
  </copy>
  ```


#### On Windows, delete the folder:

```C:\Users\<your-username>\.mcp_auth```

Then restart Claude Desktop.

#### Option 3: Clear Browser Cookie for MCP Domain

Delete cookies for your MCP server domain:

```dataaccess.adb.{region-identifier}.oraclecloudapps.com```

Example:

```dataaccess.adb.us-chicago-1.oraclecloudapps.com```

Then restart Claude Desktop.

#### Option 4: Reinstall Claude Desktop

If the issue persists:

1. Uninstall Claude Desktop.

2. Delete:

  ```%AppData%\Claude```

3. Reinstall Claude.
4. Restart and try again.

After performing one of the above steps, Claude Desktop prompts you for:

* Database username
* Database password

and then connects to MCP Server successfully.

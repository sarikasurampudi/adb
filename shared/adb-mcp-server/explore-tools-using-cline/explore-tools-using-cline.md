# Explore Tools in MCP Server with Cline

## Introduction

In the previous lab, you configured Visual Studio Code with the Cline extension to connect to the Autonomous AI Database MCP Server.

In this lab, you use Cline to process natural language prompts and call the database tools created in *Lab 3*.

You will review tool call requests, approve tool usage, and analyze structured results returned from the database.

This lab demonstrates how Cline processes requests and loads database results using the MCP Server.

Estimated Time:x

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Issue natural language prompts in Cline
* Review tool call requests
* Approve tool usage
* Observe how Cline processes multi-step requests
* Analyze formatted database results

### Prerequisites

- This lab requires completion of Lab 1 through Lab 3 and Lab 6 in the **Contents** menu on the left.


## Task 1: Discover Available Schemas
In this task, you ask Cline to retrieve the list of schemas available in your Autonomous AI Database. Cline processes your natural language prompt, selects the appropriate tool, and calls the database to load schema information.
1. In the **Type your task here...** chat field, type the following prompt and press **Enter** :

    _What schemas are available in the database?_

![Enter prompt to list schemas](./images/cline-list-schemas.png =70%x*)

2. Cline selects the LIST_SCHEMAS tool. Review the tool call details.
3. Click **Approve**.
    ![Approve the list schemas tool](./images/cline-list-schemas-approve.png =70%x*)
4. A formatted list of schemas is displayed.
![List schemas result](./images/cline-list-schemas-result.png =70%x*)


## Task 2: List Objects in a Schema

In this task, you ask Cline to retrieve database objects within a specific schema. Cline processes the prompt and calls the appropriate tool to load object information.
1. Type the following prompt in the chat field and press **Enter**:

    _What objects exist in the sales\_user schema?_
    ![Enter prompt to list objects](./images/cline-list-objects.png =70%x*)
2. Cline selects LIST_OBJECTS.
3. Click **Approve**.
    ![Approve the list objects tool](./images/cline-list-objects-approve.png =70%x*)
4. Object names and types are returned that match the `SALES_USER` schema.
    ![List objects result](./images/cline-list-objects-result.png =70%x*)


## Task 3: Retrieve Object Metadata
In this task, you request detailed metadata for a specific table. Cline processes the request and calls the metadata tool to load structural information.

1. Issue a new prompt and press **Enter**:

    _Show the metadata details of the customer table_
    ![Enter prompt to list objects](./images/cline-get-object-details.png =70%x*)
2. Cline selects GET\_OBJECT\_DETAILS.
3. Click **Approve**.
    ![Approve the list objects tool](./images/cline-get-object-details-approve.png =70%x*)
4. Structured metadata is displayed.
    ![GET\_OBJECT\_DETAILS result](./images/cline-get-object-details-result.png =70%x*)


## Task 4: Process a Business Query
In this task, you ask Cline to retrieve business data using a natural language query. Cline processes the request, selects the SQL tool, and calls the database to load the required data.
1. Issue a new prompt and press **Enter**:

    _Show top 3 customers by revenue in each region_

    ![Enter prompt to for top 3 customers](./images/cline-top3-customers-prompt.png =70%x*)
2. Cline selects LIST\_OBJECTS first. This step may vary and the LLM may present other options.
    ![Approve `LIST_OBJECTS`](./images/cline-top3-customers-list-objects.png =70%x*)

3. Review and click **Approve**.
4. Now, Cline selects EXECUTE\_SQL.
    ![Approve `EXECUTE_SQL`](./images/cline-top3-customers-execute-sql.png =70%x*)
5. Review and click **Approve**.
6. Then, Cline wants to use GET\_OBJECT\_DETAILS for ORDERS table.
    ![Approve `GET_OBJECT_DETAILS`](./images/cline-top3-customers-get-object-details.png =70%x*)
7. Review and click **Approve**.
8. Cline again uses GET\_OBJECT\_DETAILS for ORDER\_ITEMS table.
    ![Approve `GET_OBJECT_DETAILS`](./images/cline-order-items-approve.png =70%x*)
9. Review and click **Approve**.
10. Cline finally uses EXECUTE\_SQL.
    ![Approve `EXECUTE_SQL`](./images/cline-execute-sql-order-items-approve.png =70%x*)
11. Click **Approve**.
12. Cline displays a summarized and structured result and completes the task.
    ![Approve `EXECUTE_SQL`](./images/cline-execute-sql2-result.png =70%x*)

You have now successfully used both Claude Desktop and Cline to connect to the same MCP-enabled Autonomous AI Database.

## Quiz
```quiz score
Q: What triggers tool selection in Cline?
- Manual button click
- Predefined workflow
* Natural language prompt analysis
- Scheduled background task
>Cline analyzes the natural language prompt and determines which database tool should be called.

Q: Which tool retrieves structured metadata for a table?

- LIST_SCHEMAS
- LIST_OBJECTS
* GET_OBJECT_DETAILS
- EXECUTE_SQL
>GET_OBJECT_DETAILS loads metadata for the specified database object.

Q: Which tool runs business queries?

- LIST_SCHEMAS
- LIST_OBJECTS
- GET_OBJECT_DETAILS
* EXECUTE_SQL
>EXECUTE_SQL runs read-only SELECT statements to retrieve business data.
```

**This concludes the workshop**

## Troubleshooting
If tool calls fail or results are not returned correctly, review the following checks:

*Issue 1: Tool Call Fails After Approval*

**Possible Causes**
- Token expired
- Schema user mismatch
- Tool was deleted or not registered

**Solution**

1. Generate a new bearer token.
2. Confirm schema user matches the one used in Lab 3.
3. Verify tools exist:
    ```
    SELECT tool_name FROM user_cloud_ai_tools;
    ```
4. Restart Visual Studio Code.

*Issue 2: No Chat Box Visible*

If you expanded MCP configuration and cannot see the chat input:

1. Click **Done** in the MCP configuration panel.
2. Return to the Cline chat interface.
3. Enter your prompt again.

*Issue 3: EXECUTE_SQL Returns Error*

Check the following:
- Query is read-only.
- Query references existing tables.
- Table names match exact case.
- Schema user has access to the tables.

*Issue 4: Unexpected Empty Results*

Verify the following:

- Table contains data.
- Filter conditions are correct.
- Schema name is correct.
- Test directly in SQL Worksheet:

    ```
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table_name>;
    ```

*Issue 5: Connection Drops During Session*

Bearer tokens expire after approximately one hour.

If the session suddenly stops working:

1. Generate a new token. Refer to Lab 6 -> Task 3.
2. Update configuration. Refer to Lab 6 -> Task 4.
3. Restart Visual Studio Code.
